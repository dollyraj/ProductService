Calling 3rd Party APIs - 15-04-25

1. Write the mechanism to call - getAllProduct and getProductById APIs
on fakeStore
2. Create our own APIs, to get all products and getProductById which will
internally call fakeStore and show the data

CLIENT <-> ProductService <-> FakeStoreAPI

controller -> contains the APIs
service -> contains the business logic
repository -> talks to DB, does CRUD
model -> contains schema
client -> classes that will talk to other services

ProductService -> FakeStore Service
FakeStoreClient -> contains the code to communicate with FakeStore

Spring ->
RestTemplate -> becoming deprecated || today we will use RestTemplate
WebClient -> latest



Category category;

Category
    List<Product> products;


Maintain version in the API URL -> /something/v1/something/
Whenever we change the API contract -> we should also change the URL
We change the versions, v1 -> v2

New URL -> /something/v2/something
API contract -> how to use the API, the inputs required and the output structure

---------------------
repo -> Product findById(id) -> returning entire Product[5]
service -> repo -> gets entire Product[5]
controller -> service -> get entire Product[5]

controller can convert object to DTO -> return to UI with lesser attributes
ProductDTO[2]


repo -> ProductProjection findById(id) -> returns subset of Product, ProductProjection[3]
service -> gets smaller subset -> ProductProjection[3]
controller -> service -> ProductProjection[3]

controller can again use a DTO -> return even smaller subset,
ProductInfoDTO[2]
